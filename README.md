# Paion
Yet Another Calendar Application, this time written in Python with PyQt. I started
this because I didn't like any of the existing calendars. To run, just clone the
repo and type `./Paion.py`.

### Licensing
Paion is licensed under the GPLv3+, and the icons are based off the Breeze theme (LGPLv3+).

### Requirements
Python 3, PyQt5.
