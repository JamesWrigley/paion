# Paion
Yet Another Calendar Application, this time written in Python and QML. I started
this because I didn't like any of the existing calendars. To run, just clone the
repo and type `./Paion.py`.

### Licensing
Paion is licensed under the GPLv3+, the icons from the Breeze theme are LGPLv3+.

### Requirements
Python 3, PyQt5, QtQuick 2.4.
